## Course Description

The lab accompanying the course covers modeling of digital systems and electronic circuit design hierarchy and the role of methodology in FPGA/ASIC design.  Hardware Description Language, VHDL, simulation, and synthesis tools are utilized to elaborate the material covered throughout the course. The lab introduces the systematic top-down design methodology to design complex digital hardware such as FPGAs and ASICs.  FPGA and ASIC design flow as well as design optimization techniques are discussed.  For FPGAs, Xilinx Virtex architecture is covered. Group projects are assigned to students as final exam.

## Meeting:

This course is half Online and half in person. Instructor will announce any required in person meetings in advanced.
Meeting times are Tu 9:00 AM to 11:45 AM. Class attendance is not required, but is fully encouraged.
Online meeting sessions will be recorded and will be posted to "Panopto Video" tab in Canvas.
In person meetings will not be live streamed or recorded.

## Grading

Final grades will be based on the total of points earned according to the following rubric:

| Title | Desc | Total portion |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Main Source code completion | Source code shall be Synthesizable | 25% synthesizable<br/> 0% not synthesizable | 
| Testbench code completion | Testbench shall be Synthesizable | 25% synthesizable<br/> 0% not synthesizable | 
| Project specific requirements completion | All the requirements shall be met.<br/>*Each lab project has specific requirements including Hardware verification<br/>and other specifications.*| 25% complete<br/> 10% incomplete </br> 0% no submission |
| Lab report completion | See Lab report format below | 20% complete report<br/> 15% incomplete report<br/> 0% no submission |
| On-time submission | All labs are due on the given due date.<br/>Commits after due date will not be reviewed.<br/>Commits after grade submission will not be reviewed. | 5% On time submission<br/> 0% late submission |

:bangbang: **Note: Labs submitted after due date will receive 5% deduction. Labs submitted after grades are posted will not be reviewed and will receive a 0 grade.**

## Lab Report Format

Lab assignments are in GitHub classroom format.  
Students will receive a link to each assignment a day prior to the lab meeting. By clicking on the link the lab template will be forked and will be assigned to the student.
The lab report shall be submitted in the README.md with markdown format.
The following sections are required in the lab report:
| Title | Desc | Markdown format |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Class title | CSUN ECE 524 L Fall 2021 | `#` Heading 1 |
| Lab title | Name of the lab (example: FSM Design) | `##` Heading 2 |
| Student name(s) | Name of students on the project | `-` Markdown List |
| Submission date | Date when the report was submitted | MM/DD/YYYY |
| Introduction | A short description about the project | `##` Heading 2 |
